Lenna Modifier

This is a little program that takes a cropped version of the original “Lenna” photograph and applies a few various combinations of gray-scale and other modifications of color. It will prompt the user to enter a menu option to view a specific version of modification and include a “side by side” tabbed comparison as well as include my analysis of the modification. A couple of the edits did have resemblances of “old and weathered” photographs. The user may also elect to simply view all of the preloaded images at once.
